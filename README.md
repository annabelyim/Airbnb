Acknowledgement:

The datasets we are using were sourced from http://insideairbnb.com/about.html.

We are specifically using New York City's April 7th 2021 listings.csv.gz file and Los Angelese's April 7th 2021 listings.csv.gz file. 

Both files were exported and cleaned, resulting in two csv files that were used for our data visualization system: 

- UpdatedLAlistings.csv 

- UpdatedNYClistings.csv
